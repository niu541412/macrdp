//! Generic USB redirection (MS-RDPEUSB): present a client's redirected USB device
//! locally on macOS.
//!
//! macrdp is the RDP server / presenting side: the physical USB device lives on
//! the client (which runs `urbdrc`), and the server drives it and presents it
//! locally. The macOS presenting mechanism is a user-space virtual USB host
//! controller via the public `IOUSBHost.framework` class
//! `IOUSBHostControllerInterface`, which requires the (granted) entitlement
//! `com.apple.developer.usb.host-controller-interface`.
//!
//! Phase 1b proved the controller instantiates in a signed+provisioned build.
//! Phase 2 drove the full UserHCI command protocol to present a HARDCODED device.
//! Phase 3 makes it REAL and client-sourced: [`MacUsb`] installs the vendored
//! `UrbdrcServer`, and on `ADD_DEVICE` [`drive_device`] -> [`imp::present_device`]
//! creates a UserHCI controller and answers the kernel's EP0 GET_DESCRIPTOR
//! transfers by driving the device's `UsbHandle` — so the descriptors come from
//! the client over the wire and the client's device enumerates in `ioreg -p
//! IOUSB` with its real VID/PID/strings. Phase 3.2 makes it USABLE, not just
//! enumerable: `select_client_config` sends a `SelectConfiguration` URB to open the
//! device's pipes, and [`imp::present_device`] then forwards bulk transfers on those
//! pipes ([`UsbHandle::bulk_transfer_in`]/`bulk_transfer_out`) both directions — so
//! the macOS mass-storage driver's SCSI (CBW/data/CSW over the bulk endpoints) rides
//! the client's real drive. **Verified end-to-end on a real Linux FreeRDP client**
//! (UTM-QEMU Ubuntu + a USB-2.0 hub, claimable mass-storage interface): a
//! client-redirected flash drive (ESD310C, VID 0x2174/PID 0x2100) **mounts on the
//! Mac and stays mounted** (1300+ steady bulk transfers, no resets/timeouts). Two
//! correctness fixes were load-bearing for that: (1) the same physical device is
//! deduped on its stable hardware identity (see [`PRESENTED_DEVICES`]) because the
//! client announces it twice with differing instance ids — presenting both duels
//! two virtual drives over one device (SCSI timeouts); (2) a completion that races a
//! device reset (which destroys+recreates the endpoint) is dropped on the Obj-C side
//! by endpoint-object identity, not just liveness — see `usb_spike.m`. EP0
//! **control-OUT** requests the local kernel issues (a mass-storage Bulk-Only Reset /
//! Clear-Feature(HALT), needed for SCSI error recovery) are forwarded to the real
//! device too, via [`UsbHandle::control_transfer_out`]; the standard requests the
//! host controller / SelectConfiguration already own
//! (SET_ADDRESS/CONFIGURATION/INTERFACE) stay a local ACK. EP0 **control-IN** is
//! generic too: a standard device-recipient `GET_DESCRIPTOR` rides the dedicated
//! descriptor URB (the verified enumeration path), and everything else — class/vendor
//! INs like mass-storage `Get Max LUN`, interface-directed ones like a HID
//! report-descriptor read — forwards via [`UsbHandle::control_transfer_in`] with the
//! raw SETUP preserved. Both directions translate the SETUP packet into the specific
//! **typed** URB function real Windows uses (`URB_FUNCTION_CLASS_INTERFACE`,
//! `GET_DESCRIPTOR_FROM_INTERFACE`, …) rather than the generic
//! `URB_FUNCTION_CONTROL_TRANSFER_EX`, which mstsc rejects with 0x80070057 (FreeRDP
//! accepts either) — see the vendored server's `setup_to_typed_urb`. Transfers are
//! serviced **concurrently** (one task each): the ObjC ring walk serializes per
//! endpoint, and cross-endpoint independence is what keeps a long-outstanding
//! transfer (an idle interrupt-IN, a wedged bulk) from blocking EP0 — notably the
//! reset that recovers the wedge. Every transfer await races `closed()` so a
//! disconnect mid-transfer tears down instead of wedging. Remaining 3.2 work:
//! retract/hot-unplug, true multi-device. All Obj-C /
//! IOUSBHost SPI touches are quarantined
//! in `usb_spike.m` (the maintenance boundary), built + linked by `build.rs` on
//! macOS; the standalone `--usb-spike` path still presents the hardcoded synthetic
//! device through the same async completion machinery.
